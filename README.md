# Ignite Feed

It is a generic social media feed, named Ignite Feed, (for now) made with React + Vite. <br>

In this social media we have profile section on the side and the feed section on center of screen.
So in the feed section we can create a text post and also be able to comment on others and on our own, 
in addition we can like other comments.
